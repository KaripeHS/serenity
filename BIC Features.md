# Best-in-Class Features for a Non-Medical Home Health Agency

Operating a non-medical home health agency requires a broad set of capabilities to ensure high-quality care, regulatory compliance, efficient operations and sustainable profits. Leading platforms like ShiftCare, CareSmartz360, Alora and others illustrate what "best in class" looks like. The following features are organized by priority and explain how each function improves efficiency and profitability.

---

## 1. Scheduling & Rostering (High Priority)

**Drag-and-drop scheduling & recurring shifts** – A visual scheduler allows coordinators to assign caregivers quickly and duplicate recurring appointments. ShiftCare's scheduler supports recurring shifts, group rosters and search/filter functions and shows caregivers' availability to avoid double bookings.

**Staff availability and job board** – Caregivers can enter their availability; open shifts are posted to a job board where qualified staff can bid, with automated rules evaluating skills, certifications and location. Smart matching reduces time spent filling shifts.

**Automated notifications** – Publishing a roster sends SMS or push notifications; caregivers accept or decline via the app, reducing phone calls and miscommunication. Instant alerts for no-shows or incident reporting keep schedules on track.

> **Why it matters:** Efficient rostering maximises utilisation. Automated matching and notifications reduce admin time and overtime, leading to higher billable hours and less unfilled time slots. Accurate staffing also improves client satisfaction and reduces caregiver burnout.

---

## 2. Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) & Time Tracking (High Priority)

**GPS-enabled clock-in/out** – Caregivers clock in/out through a mobile app; GPS logs verify location and time. Client signatures provide additional proof of service.

**Real-time visit tracking & reason codes** – Real-time tracking alerts coordinators to late arrivals or missed visits. Reason codes explain deviations, which helps agencies stay compliant with payer requirements.

**Expense & mileage tracking** – Caregivers can log mileage and upload receipt photos through the app; the system automatically calculates travel reimbursement.

> **Why it matters:** EVV is mandated in many states and payers. Accurate visit verification prevents billing disputes, reduces fraud and speeds up reimbursements. Mileage tracking ensures caregivers are fairly compensated and prevents under- or overpayment.

---

## 3. Care Plan Management & Goal Tracking (High Priority)

**Integrated care plans** – ShiftCare links care goals to daily rosters so caregivers see tasks alongside their schedules. Plans embed health information and tasks into each shift, ensuring continuity of care.

**Real-time progress monitoring** – Managers and families view goal progress and notes in real time, enabling early intervention.

**Scalability & flexibility** – Plans are easily updated and scale as services grow.

> **Why it matters:** Synchronising care plans with rosters reduces errors and improves outcomes. Real-time visibility ensures tasks are completed and goals met, enhancing client satisfaction and enabling agencies to bill accurately for services delivered.

---

## 4. Documentation & Progress Notes (High Priority)

**Speech-to-text note-taking & AI summarisation** – Caregivers dictate progress notes via voice on mobile; the system captures and uploads them. AI can summarise notes and flag risk keywords to identify issues sooner.

**Custom templates & incident reporting** – Agencies design templates tailored to clients or funding requirements. Incident management tools capture all details and store them securely for audits.

**Secure sharing & access control** – Notes are shared with authorised staff and families while maintaining confidentiality.

> **Why it matters:** Efficient documentation reduces clerical workload and ensures accurate records for audits. Voice-to-text and templates reduce missing information and free caregivers to focus on care. AI summarisation highlights trends and reduces time spent reviewing long notes.

---

## 5. Billing, Invoicing & Funds Management (High Priority)

**Integrated billing & invoicing** – The platform ties timesheets, travel and expenses to billing; NDIS or Medicaid pricing is auto-updated, and invoices can be generated and bulk-claimed directly from the system.

**Accounting integration** – Timesheet approvals flow into accounting software (e.g., Xero) for payroll and billing.

**Funds & budget management** – Providers can track client plan spending, forecast funds and receive alerts when balances are low. Reports consolidate service delivery and payments to avoid overspending.

> **Why it matters:** Automated billing decreases manual errors and speeds up cash flow. Real-time visibility into funds helps agencies avoid unbillable hours and ensures clients do not exceed budgets. Integration with accounting reduces data entry and administrative cost.

---

## 6. Recruitment & Onboarding (High Priority)

**Applicant tracking & hiring portal** – Systems like CareSmartz360's recruitment module centralise job postings, screen candidates based on experience and certifications and manage applications in one dashboard.

**Credential & compliance tracking** – HR tools track license and certification expirations and send automated reminders to caregivers and recruiters.

**Streamlined onboarding & training** – Automated workflows collect required documents, assign onboarding tasks and ensure new hires complete compliance training quickly.

> **Why it matters:** With chronic caregiver shortages, efficient recruitment shortens time-to-hire, reduces hiring costs and ensures new staff are compliant from day one. Centralised credential tracking prevents scheduling caregivers whose certificates have lapsed, avoiding fines.

---

## 7. Caregiver & Staff Mobile Apps (High Priority)

**Caregiver app** – Provides updated rosters, client details, care plans and progress notes on iOS/Android; allows clocking in/out with GPS, logging mileage and capturing expenses. Caregivers receive shift reminders and can update availability.

**Mobile admin app** – Managers adjust or cancel shifts on the go, reassign staff via the job board and view real-time clock-in status. Push notifications alert them to missed clock-ins, incomplete documentation and refused medications, enabling quick resolution.

> **Why it matters:** Mobile tools empower frontline staff and administrators to manage schedules, document care and respond to issues without returning to the office. This reduces travel time, speeds decision-making and supports remote, distributed operations.

---

## 8. Artificial Intelligence & Automation (Medium Priority)

**AI-generated notes & risk detection** – AI summarises voice-dictated notes and flags risky phrases (e.g., "fall," "pain"), prompting staff to intervene.

**AI rostering & shift bidding** – Algorithms analyse caregiver skills, availability and location to recommend best matches for shifts and automate job board invitations.

**Award interpretation & pay-rule compliance** – AI monitors shift patterns to detect pay-rule breaches (e.g., overtime) and sends warnings.

> **Why it matters:** AI reduces manual planning, predicts staffing needs and ensures fair pay, lowering compliance risk and overtime costs. Automated summarisation of notes saves supervisors time and highlights issues earlier.

---

## 9. Reporting, Analytics & Dashboards (Medium Priority)

**Business performance analytics** – Pre-configured dashboards track billable hours, costs, productivity and revenue per client, offering actionable insights. Utilisation dashboards show who is over- or under-worked and highlight unfilled shifts.

## 11. Communication & Collaboration (Medium Priority)

**Integrated messaging & chat** – Secure, HIPAA-compliant messaging replaces scattered texts and emails; messages, images and documents are stored centrally for audit trails.

**Care team collaboration & family portal** – Families can view schedules, visit records, care summaries and staff profiles via a secure portal. They can request additional services and receive updates, reducing inbound calls.

**Multi-payer & multi-location support** – Systems can manage private pay, Medicaid, Veteran Affairs, and long-term care insurance funding within one platform. Multi-office capabilities allow franchisors to standardise workflows across sites.

> **Why it matters:** Interoperability eliminates duplicate data entry, reduces errors and ensures consistency across systems. It also supports growth into new markets and payer types.

---

## 15. Telehealth & Remote Monitoring (Lower Priority for Non-Medical Agencies)

**Video conferencing & virtual visits** – Platforms like AlayaCare provide integrated video capabilities to facilitate remote check-ins, wellness calls and supervisory visits.

**Remote patient monitoring** – Some home care software integrates with wearables to record vitals and share data with clinicians (relevant when agencies partner with home health providers).
