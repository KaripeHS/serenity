## 5. Hours Bonus

### 5.1 Formula

> **Hours Bonus = Total Hours Worked × Hourly Rate × 1%**

### 5.2 Calculation Basis
- **Total Hours Worked:** All hours worked during the prior calendar year (January 1 – December 31)
- **Hourly Rate:** Employee's base hourly rate as of December 31 of the bonus year

### 5.3 Examples

| Hours Worked | Hourly Rate | Calculation | Total Bonus |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1,040 | $15.00 | 1,040 × $15 × 1% | $156.00 |
| 1,560 | $15.00 | 1,560 × $15 × 1% | $234.00 |
| 2,080 | $15.00 | 2,080 × $15 × 1% | $312.00 |
| 1,560 | $18.00 | 1,560 × $18 × 1% | $280.80 |

### 5.4 Payout Timing
The Hours Bonus is paid in two equal installments:

- First installment (50%): June paycheck
- Second installment (50%): December paycheck

**Employee must be employed on each payout date to receive that installment. Installments are evaluated independently.**

### 5.5 Forfeiture Examples
- Employee separates in April: Receives $0 (not employed in June or December)
- Employee separates in September: Receives 50% (June installment only)
- Employee employed through December: Receives 100%

---

## 7. General Provisions

### 7.1 Employment Requirement
**For all bonus components, the employee must be actively employed on the scheduled payout date to receive payment. Employees who separate from employment prior to a payout date forfeit that bonus payment.**

### 7.2 Definitions
- **Scheduled Shift:** Any shift assigned to the employee in the scheduling system
- **Clean EVV:** A visit with valid clock-in and clock-out captured within the EVV system, accepted by Sandata
- **No-Call/No-Show:** Failure to report for a scheduled shift without advance notification
- **Substantiated Complaint:** A client or family complaint that has been investigated and determined to be valid by management
- **Good Standing:** No active disciplinary action, performance improvement plan, or pending investigation

### 7.3 Cancellation Rules
**Client Cancellations:** Any shift canceled by the client does not count against the caregiver's attendance or scheduled shifts total for bonus eligibility. Caregivers are considered available and willing to work for those shifts.

**Employee Cancellations:** Any shift canceled by the employee with less than 24 hours' notice counts as a missed scheduled shift for attendance purposes and will impact bonus eligibility.

### 7.4 System of Record
All attendance, EVV, hours, and compliance metrics are based on the data in the company's official systems of record (EVV/Sandata, scheduling software, payroll system). These systems are the sole source of truth for all bonus calculations. Discrepancies must be reported within 7 days of occurrence to be considered for correction.

### 7.5 Calculation Rules
All percentage calculations are computed to two decimal places with no rounding. To meet a 95% threshold, the caregiver must achieve exactly 95.00% or higher. Dollar amounts are rounded to the nearest cent.

### 7.6 Pro-Ration
The Show Up Bonus is not pro-rated. Employees must work the full quarter to be eligible. New hires who start mid-quarter are evaluated beginning with their first full quarter.

### 7.7 Disputes
Employees may request a review of their bonus calculation within 30 days of the payout date by submitting a written request to HR. HR will respond with a detailed calculation breakdown within 10 business days.

### 7.8 Policy Modifications
Serenity Care Partners reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate this bonus program at any time with 30 days written notice to employees. Any changes will not affect bonuses already earned but not yet paid.
