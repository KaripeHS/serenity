## 📱 Mobile Check-In ("Commuter Mode")

We have launched a new feature to ensure your safety and streamline compliance.

### How it Works
1.  **Notification:** 30 minutes before your shift, you will receive an SMS/Email alert.
2.  **Click:** Open the link on your phone.
3.  **Confirm:** Tap the **"I Am On My Way"** button.
    *   *This logs your location and lets the office know you are safe and en route.*
4.  **Arrival:** Proceed to the patient's home as usual.

### FAQ
*   **What if I forget?** The office will be alerted and may call you to check if everything is okay.
*   **Does it track me all day?** No. It only logs a single GPS point when you click "I Am On My Way" to prove commute intent.

## 📋 Best Practices
*   Always keep your profile credentials up to date.
*   Ensure your EVV check-in/out is done *inside* the patient's home to avoid "Red Flag" shifts.
